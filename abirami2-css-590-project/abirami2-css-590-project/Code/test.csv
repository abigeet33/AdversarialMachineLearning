forcing unwanted people united states many cases criminals drug dealers rapists etc claim might false mexico intentionally send criminals us best statement seems plausible trump meant conditions generated mexico government lead criminals u case trump proposes secure southern border implementing various security measures recurring proposal build wall along areas border lacking natural barriers proposal widely criticized people construed sign racism xenophobia etc however understand many trump followers actually cheer build wall build wall first worries murders drugs crimes terrorism

difference combination likely responsible shift seen due voters changing minds perhaps differences poll response rates though unclear factors important clear race democrats hoped would landslide looking like nail biter weeks following democratic convention late july trump poll standing plummeted probably partly clinton got convention bounce another factor likely trump high profile attacks

americans given child rules got plug rates think taxes complicated figure much owe things like investment income wages self employment lots deductions fill boxes subtract figuring rate easy using

charitable deduction economists think tax base fewer loopholes less subject evasion less distortionary economic activity weinzierl said idea loophole closures offset tax revenue lost cutting brackets always works call fewer tax brackets every case real motive lowering tax burden highest income americans making life simpler middle class kleinbard argued consider bush tax proposal example limits deductions also would overwhelmingly benefit highest earners grow national debt unless unprecedented growth economy cutting deductions loopholes makes great sound bite far tougher sounds politically
